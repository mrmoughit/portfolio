        "description": "I deploy and maintain production web applications across multi-cloud environments (GCP, Oracle Cloud, AWS), focusing on automation, reliability, and performance. By architecting CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI, I reduced deployment cycles from manual processes to automated 10-minute workflows. I implement infrastructure best practices including staging/production separation, Docker containerization for reproducible builds, and CDN integration that improved page load times by 40%. My infrastructure management maintains 99.9% uptime through load balancing, auto-scaling groups, and infrastructure-as-code practices that enable consistent provisioning and disaster recovery capabilities.",
